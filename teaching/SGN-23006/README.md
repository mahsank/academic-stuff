These exercises were taught as part of `Advanced Filter Design` course at Tampere University of Technology during
fall 2014 (1st and 2nd period). There were a total of 11 exercises. Please note that there is some overlap between these
exercises and the ones available in other courses as this course was the result of merger between two other courses
(SGN-2016 and SGN-2056).
